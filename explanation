class UniqueCounter:
This line declares a class named UniqueCounter.

    def __init__(self, list1):
        self.list1 = list1
        self.unique_list = self.unique()
        self.count_and_multiply = self.count_unique_and_multiply()
This is the constructor method (__init__) for the UniqueCounter class.
It takes a parameter list1 and initializes instance variables list1, unique_list, and count_and_multiply.
self.list1 stores the input list passed to the constructor.
self.unique_list is initialized by calling the unique() method, which returns a list of unique sublists from list1.
self.count_and_multiply is initialized by calling the count_unique_and_multiply() method,
which calculates the count and multiplication results for each sublist in self.unique_list.


    def unique(self):
        unique_lists = []
        for sublist in self.list1:
            sublist_set = set(sublist)
            unique_lists.append(list(sublist_set))
        return unique_lists
This method, unique(), takes no arguments and returns a list of unique sublists.
It initializes an empty list unique_lists to store the unique sublists.
It iterates over each sublist in self.list1.
For each sublist, it converts it to a set using set(sublist). 
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements, so any duplicate elements in the sublist will be removed.
The resulting set is converted back to a list using list(sublist_set) to preserve the original order of elements.
The unique sublist is then appended to unique_lists.
Finally, unique_lists is returned.


    def count_unique_and_multiply(self):
        result = []
        for sublist in self.unique_list:
            unique_count = len(sublist)
            product = 1
            for num in sublist:
                product *= num
            result.append((unique_count, product))
        return result
This method, count_unique_and_multiply(), takes no arguments and returns a list of tuples containing the count and 
product for each unique sublist.
It initializes an empty list result to store the count and product tuples.
It iterates over each sublist in self.unique_list (the list of unique sublists).
For each sublist, it calculates the length of the sublist using len(sublist) and assigns it to unique_count.
It initializes a variable product with a value of 1.
It then iterates over each number (num) in the sublist and multiplies it with product.
The final product value and unique_count are appended as a tuple (unique_count, product) to result.
Finally, result is returned.


list1 = [[27, 9, 2, 8, 8, 9, 27, 8], [1, 18, 2, 1, 18, 4, 4, 1], [1, 5, 7, 5, 8, 7, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 3]]

counter = UniqueCounter(list1)
These lines define the input list list1 and create an instance of the UniqueCounter class named counter with list1 as the argument.


print(counter.unique_list)
print(counter.count_and_multiply)
These lines print the unique_list and count_and_multiply attributes of the counter instance,
which were computed during initialization. The unique_list contains the list of unique sublists, 
and count_and_multiply contains the count and multiplication results for each unique sublist.


counts = []
multiplications = []

for count, multi in counter.count_and_multiply:
    counts.append(count)
    multiplications.append(multi)

print("Counts:", counts)
print("Multiplications:", multiplications)
These lines extract the count and multiplication results from the counter.
count_and_multiply attribute and store them in separate lists counts and multiplications.
It iterates over each tuple (count, multi) in counter.count_and_multiply.
For each tuple, it appends the count to the counts list and the multi to the multiplications list.
Finally, it prints the contents of counts and multiplications.
